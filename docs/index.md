# NØMAD

**NØde Monitoring And Diagnostics** — Lightweight HPC monitoring, visualization, and predictive analytics.

> *"Travels light, adapts to its environment, and doesn't need permanent infrastructure."*

## What is NØMAD?

NØMAD is a self-contained monitoring and prediction system for HPC clusters. Unlike heavyweight solutions requiring complex infrastructure, NØMAD deploys quickly, runs with minimal resources, and provides actionable insights through:

- **Real-time monitoring** of disk, CPU, memory, GPU, and SLURM jobs
- **Predictive analytics** using machine learning and similarity networks
- **Educational analytics** tracking computational proficiency development
- **Multi-cluster dashboards** with partition-level views
- **Derivative analysis** detecting accelerating trends before thresholds

## Philosophy

Inspired by nomadic principles:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Travels light** | SQLite database, minimal dependencies, no external services |
| **Adapts to environment** | Configurable collectors, flexible alerts, cluster-agnostic |
| **Leaves no trace** | Clean uninstall, no system modifications required |

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install nomad-hpc
nomad demo                    # Try with synthetic data
nomad dashboard               # Open http://localhost:8050
```

For production deployment, see [Installation](installation.md).
