**Re:** Submission of "NØMAD: Lightweight HPC Monitoring and Diagnostics with Machine Learning-Based Failure Prediction"

---

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript "NØMAD: Lightweight HPC Monitoring and Diagnostics with Machine Learning-Based Failure Prediction" for consideration as a Software Metapaper in the Journal of Open Research Software.

## Summary

NØMAD is a lightweight monitoring and predictive analytics tool designed for computing infrastructure. Unlike heavyweight enterprise solutions that require complex infrastructure, NØMAD provides system-level monitoring on any Linux system using only a SQLite database, with optional SLURM integration for HPC-specific job analytics. The software employs machine learning models—including Graph Neural Networks, LSTMs, and Autoencoders—to predict job failures before they occur, enabling proactive intervention and user guidance.

The software is openly available on GitHub (https://github.com/jtonini/nomade) under the AGPL-3.0 license and on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/nomade-hpc/). A demo mode allows users to evaluate the tool without requiring HPC infrastructure.

## Relevance to JORS

NØMAD addresses a gap in the HPC monitoring ecosystem by providing a zero-infrastructure alternative to enterprise tools while offering predictive capabilities absent from existing lightweight solutions. The software has been tested on clusters ranging from 6 to 200 nodes and is designed for broad reuse by small research groups, university HPC centers, and educational settings.

## APC Waiver Request

I respectfully request a full waiver of the Article Processing Charge for the following reasons:

1. **No dedicated funding**: This work was developed as part of my role supporting research computing at the University of Richmond, without dedicated grant funding for software development or publication costs.

2. **Open source contribution**: NØMAD is released under the AGPL-3.0 license, freely available to the research community. The goal is to democratize HPC monitoring capabilities for institutions that cannot afford enterprise solutions.

3. **Single author from a small institution**: As the sole developer and author, I do not have access to departmental funds or co-author institutions that could share publication costs.

4. **Community benefit**: The software directly benefits under-resourced research groups and educational institutions—the same communities that would be deterred by APCs from publishing their open-source contributions.

I believe waiving the APC aligns with JORS's mission to promote open research software and would enable continued development and documentation of tools that serve the broader research community.
